The notebook contains a Black Box Ordinary Differential Equations(ODE) solver that I've implemented from scratch. Since it's my first such foray, I've only solved a simple exponential growth problem.
The methods used are:

1).Euler's Method

2).Mid Point method(higher order ODEs)

3).Runge Kutta 4th order(RK4)
